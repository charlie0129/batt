Due to macOS limitations, batt will be paused when your computer goes to sleep. As a result, when you are in a charging session and your computer goes to sleep, there is no way for batt to stop charging (since batt is paused by macOS) and the battery will charge to 100%. This option, together with disable-charging-pre-sleep, will prevent this from happening.

This option tells macOS NOT to go to sleep when the computer is in a charging session, so batt can continue to work until charging is finished. Note that it will only prevent **idle** sleep, when 1) charging is active 2) battery charge limit is enabled. So your computer can go to sleep as soon as a charging session is completed.

However, this options does not prevent manual sleep (limitation of macOS). For example, if you manually put your computer to sleep (by choosing the Sleep option in the top-left Apple menu) or close the lid, batt will still be paused and the issue mentioned above will still happen. This is where disable-charging-pre-sleep comes in.`,

As described in preventing-idle-sleep, batt will be paused by macOS when your computer goes to sleep, and there is no way for batt to continue controlling battery charging. This option will disable charging just before sleep, so your computer will not overcharge during sleep, even if the battery charge is below the limit.`,

1) charging is active
2) battery charge limit is enabled
3) computer is connected to charger.
So your computer can go to sleep as soon as a charging session is completed / charger disconnected.

Does similar thing to prevent-idle-sleep, but works for manual sleep too.
